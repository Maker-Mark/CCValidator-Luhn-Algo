# Setting Started

If you're using a virtual environment, activate it and install the dependencies via a `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Note: You may need to try `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the Program

Simply navigate to the app folder with a `cd app` and run the app via `python app.py` or `python3 app.py`.

The application should be running at `http://127.0.0.0:5000/` or `localhost:5000`

### Why I implemented the Luhn algorithm with JavaScript

I preferred to implement the luhn algorithm with javascript as I saw it a quicker way to implement the algorithem into a working, small appliaation, namely a checkout page. However, using javascript to parse user input as opposed to another language such as scheme is not as simple as many would like. In particular, the JavaScript syntax has weaknesses

with concrete examples and describe some ways that people/orgs have tried to overcome the weaknesses?
